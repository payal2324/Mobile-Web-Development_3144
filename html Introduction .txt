Web Development
Three languages used for web dev:
HTML (structure / content of webpage)
CSS  (colors, fonts, text sizes, etc, make it pretty!)
Javascript (talking to database, creating more complicated actions, etc)
HTML
Composed of elements (tags)
Every element has an opening and closing tag
You can nest elements (put elements inside each other)
The stuff inside an element is called content
Content = text or other tags
Every tag has a relationship with another tag
Parent, child, siblings, grandchild, grandparent, etc
The order of your elements is the order it will appear on the screen.
Software for creating HTML
Notepad editor (Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad, Notepad++, TextEdit)

This is the basic template for an HTML5 page.
Copy and paste this into your html file as a starter.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>
<body>
Content of the document......
</body>
</html>
CSS:
Used to change the style (look and feel) of your html elements
Style = font, color, decorations, borders, etc
Places to put your CSS:
Directly apply it to the element
Put it in the <head> section
Put it in an external CSS file.
For #1, css can only be applied to the current element
For #2,#3, you can choose which element you want css applied to
CSS selectors:
P {}  -> apply your css to all P elements
.abc {} -> apply your css to any elements with class=”abc”
#moon {} -> apply css to the element with id=”moon” (there should only be 1 element named “moon”)
